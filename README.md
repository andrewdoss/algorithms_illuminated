### Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations of classic algorithms covered in the Algorithms Illuminated book series (better known as the Stanford Algorithms MOOC). So far, I am building correctness and efficiency test cases for each algorithm.

I make efforts to disclaim where the implementations are made from pseudo-code in the books and where I have referenced someone else's actual implementation. The purpose of this repository is to practice implementing algorithms, so I generally implement my own solutions before refering to actual implementations. 

### Contents

#### Part 1 - The Basics

Key concepts:
* algorithmic complexity analysis through bounding asymptotic growth
* recursive divide-and-conquer approaches with Master Method time complexity analysis of recurrence relations
* using randomization for efficient average time complexity  

Practice implementations:
* Chapter 1 - selection sort, merge sort, recursive integer multiplication, Karatsuba multiplication (optimized recursive integer multiplication)
* Chapter 2 - no programming exercises (asymptotic notation/analysis theory)
* Chapter 3 - merge-sort based O(nlogn) inversion counting
* Chapter 4 - linear search, binary search
* Chapter 5 - quicksort
* Chapter 6 - linear-time selection (of order statistics)
