### Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations of classic algorithms covered in the Algorithms Illuminated book series (better known as the Stanford Algorithms MOOC). So far, I am building correctness and efficiency test cases for each algorithm.

I make efforts to disclaim where the implementations are made from pseudo-code in the books and where I have referenced someone else's actual implementation. The purpose of this repository is to practice implementing algorithms, so I generally implement my own solutions before refering to actual implementations.
